const faqs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "What programming language should I learn first?",
    answer: "For complete beginners, we recommend starting with Python. It has simple, readable syntax and is used in many fields including web development, data science, and automation. JavaScript is also a great choice if you're interested in web development specifically."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How long does it take to learn programming?",
    answer: "This varies greatly depending on your goals and how much time you dedicate. You can write simple programs within a few weeks, but becoming proficient typically takes 6-12 months of consistent practice. Mastering programming is a lifelong journey as technology constantly evolves."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Do I need a computer science degree to become a programmer?",
    answer: "No, a computer science degree is not required to become a programmer. Many successful developers are self-taught or have completed coding bootcamps. What matters most is your ability to solve problems and write clean, functional code."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What's the difference between programming and coding?",
    answer: "The terms are often used interchangeably, but programming typically refers to the entire process of creating software (planning, designing, coding, testing), while coding specifically refers to writing the actual code instructions."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Can I learn programming for free?",
    answer: "Absolutely! There are many free resources available including online tutorials, documentation, YouTube videos, and platforms like freeCodeCamp, Codecademy (free tier), and Khan Academy. Our community also provides free help and support."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What equipment do I need to start programming?",
    answer: "You just need a computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux) and an internet connection. Most programming tools and editors are free. You don't need an expensive or powerful computer to start learning - even basic laptops work fine for beginners."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Is programming difficult to learn?",
    answer: "Programming can be challenging, especially at first, but it's definitely learnable with patience and practice. The key is to start with basics, practice regularly, and not get discouraged by initial difficulties. Everyone struggles at first - it's part of the learning process."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "What career opportunities are available for programmers?",
    answer: "Programming opens doors to many careers: web developer, mobile app developer, software engineer, data scientist, game developer, cybersecurity specialist, DevOps engineer, and many more. The tech industry offers excellent salaries and job security."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Should I specialize in one programming language or learn multiple?",
    answer: "Start by becoming proficient in one language first. Once you're comfortable with programming concepts, learning additional languages becomes much easier. Different languages are better for different purposes, so eventually learning multiple languages is beneficial."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "How do I stay motivated while learning programming?",
    answer: "Set small, achievable goals and celebrate your progress. Build projects that interest you, join communities like ours for support, and remember that every expert was once a beginner. Focus on the problem-solving aspect and the satisfaction of creating something functional."
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "What's the best way to practice programming?",
    answer: "The best practice is building projects. Start with simple programs and gradually increase complexity. Practice coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank, contribute to open source projects, and try to code a little bit every day."
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: "How do I debug my code when it doesn't work?",
    answer: "Debugging is a crucial skill. Read error messages carefully, use print statements to check variable values, break your code into smaller parts, and use debugging tools in your IDE. Don't hesitate to ask for help in our community when you're stuck."
